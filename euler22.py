# Sort names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, into alphabetical order
# Score each name in the following way: multiply its alphabetical value by its numerical position in the list

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
# is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
